My practice page for FCC

I created a practice page to help me understand what I was learning at FreeCodeCamp.  I took my Chemistry book and tried to create a page that looked like the book.

Things to know:

I have only been through the Responsive Web Design Certification section.

I have not done the projects yet.

Boils down to that I have learned HTML and CSS

I then switched over to the W3 tutorials.

The code is ugly because I don't know what I am doing really.  

As I move through both FCC and W3 I add stuff to the page and refine.  

Remember this is rough.
